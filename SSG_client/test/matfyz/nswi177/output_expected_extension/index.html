          <p>
            The goal of the course is to acquaint students with the principles
            of UNIX and operating systems based on GNU/Linux. The course
            focuses primarily on the practical aspects of working in a
            UNIX-like environment and basic administration tasks. The graduates
            are expected to be capable of installing, configuring, and (with
            the use of scripting) effectively using tools and services that
            serve as the basis of a modern software development infrastructure.
          </p>
